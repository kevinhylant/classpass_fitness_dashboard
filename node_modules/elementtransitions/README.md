## ElementTransitions.js

#### [Demo and example code](http://dan-silver.github.io/ElementTransitions.js/)

This repository is a wrapper around the code provided by a [codrops article on page transitions](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/05/07/a-collection-of-page-transitions/).  Their code has been modified to allow more than one animatable element per page.  Additionally, you can now add transitions straight from html tags.
